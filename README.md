# Gesture-Recognition

This repository purpose is to test and evaluate the use of pose estimation for sports scoring such as rhythmic gymnastics.

The project can be slit in several steps :

1) Pose estimation
2) Scoring

## Pose estimation

A quick search on pose estimation models give us the following papers.
MoveNet and PoseNet are implemented within the Tensorflow library [1].
We will use those model for the first tests.

I would then be interesting to look for better models.
For example : MMPose, ViTPose, PCT, OmniPose, AlphaPose, YOLO-NAS, OpenPose [2], [3], [4]
