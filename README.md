# Gesture-Recognition

This repository purpose is to test and evaluate the use of pose estimation for sports scoring such as rhythmic gymnastics.

The project can be slit in several steps :

1) Pose estimation
2) Scoring

## Pose estimation

A quick search on pose estimation models give us the following papers :
MoveNet and PoseNet are implemented within the Tensorflow library [1].
Paper with code gives us the following models to consider : ViTPose, PCT, OmniPose
